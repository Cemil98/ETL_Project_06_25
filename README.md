# ETL_Project_06_25
06-2025 - My first ETL

In this repository. I will build a basic ETL pipeline. As I am in the process of developing data engineering skills hopefully this project will outline my basic understanding. I will be using Python and pandas to extract, transform and load the data into a clean dataframe.



20/06/2025: I checked my final outputs and found errors in my final table. However this is my first ETL pipeline in Python and so I will keep it there as a reminder to improve my coding and validation checks.
